# Obstacle-detecting-robot
The Obstacle Detecting Robot is an autonomous mobile robot designed to detect and avoid obstacles in its path using sensors. It typically uses ultrasonic, infrared, or LiDAR sensors to measure the distance between the robot and nearby objects. Based on this input, the robot makes real-time decisions to stop, turn, or change direction, ensuring smooth and collision-free movement. This project is commonly used in robotics education to demonstrate basic principles of autonomous navigation, sensor integration, and microcontroller programming. It lays the foundation for more advanced applications such as robotic vacuum cleaners, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse automation systems.
